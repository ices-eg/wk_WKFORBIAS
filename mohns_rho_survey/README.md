## Abstract

A number of ICES stock assessments have shown consistent retrospective patterns in the estimates of population metrics from successive assessments.  The patterns in the estimates of SSB (sometimes referred to as bias) from these assessments can be positive (overestimates – population abundance successively revised downwards) or negative (underestimates – population abundance successively revised upwards).  These patterns will result in catch forecasts being found to be either consistently higher or lower than the target fishing mortality. Causes of the retrospective patterns are various and often difficult to identify.

In 2018 and 2019, ICES expert groups were asked to calculate the Mohn’s rho statistic as a diagnostic of retrospective patterns.  These results have been collated and used with an existing rule of thumb to identify fish stocks assessed by ICES that suffer from significant retrospective patterns. Results indicate that 15 to 20% of age -structured stock assessments have significant retrospective patterns based on the rule of thumb. The use of Mohn’s rho as a diagnostic tool to identify these patterns is discussed.
