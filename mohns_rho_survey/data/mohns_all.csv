Regarding the terminal year/intermediate year issue:
For instance in the assessment we have conducted right now, we have used data up to 2018 (including preliminary catches in 2018), which means that we get estimates for Recruitment (age 1) at the beginning of 2019 and SSB, F in semester 1 and 2 and Hr up to 2018. So we’ve computed the  Mohn’s rho for recruitment in the intermediate year (used for the STF) and for SSB, F sem1 and sem2 and harvest rate in to the terminal year.
